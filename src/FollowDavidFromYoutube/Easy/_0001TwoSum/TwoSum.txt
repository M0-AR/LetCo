Question
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
    numbers such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
    not use the same element twice.

    You can return the answer in any order.

    Constraints:
        - 2 <= nums.length <= 10^3
        - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
        - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
        - Only one valid answer exists.

Thoughts Before Coding:
    - By using brute force approach
        - We will approach a nested 'for' loop
            - For each of the element 'x', we will perform a 'for' loop to find 'y',
              where 'x + y' is equal to the 'target'
        - The time complexity is O(n^2)
